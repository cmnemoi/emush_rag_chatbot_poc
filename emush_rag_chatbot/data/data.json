This only requires the ship's main drive, the PILGRED Reactor, to be repaired, which will enable the  Commander to steer the ship back home. - After the elimination of all  Mush agents, of course.\nPILGRED can be found in the Engine Room at the rear of the ship and repairs are mainly performed by  Raluca. For best efficiency,  Technician characters (or anyone, if Technicians aren't available) should reset Raluca's progress regularly. Once PILGRED is repaired, the Return to Sol action is unlocked in the Command Terminal.\nFor a generous  boost, the cure to Mush infection aka  Retro-Fungal Serum must have been researched when the ship sets sail for home. The Serum can be created by conducting Research in the Laboratory.  In addition to  Mush Sample and  Zhong Chun's presence in the lab, researching the Serum requires presence of the  Mush Genome Disk and a dead Mush as a sample.\nAny other completed anti-Mush research gives bonus Glory upon returning to Sol as well.\n\nEscape to Eden\nThe vastly more difficult, but also vastly more -prestiguous option is to colonize a new utopian world named Eden as a new base fo humanity. This also requires the repairs of the PILGRED Reactor, but the crew must also triangulate the position of the wondrous world using three Starmap Fragments. \nWhen doing Expeditions, the crew can discover rare alien artifacts; among them the  Starmap Fragments. Researching these enables the construction of the Calculator in the Nexus which, if used with 3 of the Starmap Fragments, reveals the location of Eden and enables the ship to navigate there, assuming the PILGRED reactor is repaired.\nHaving the time for all that on top of everything else, however, requires exceptional teamwork and coordination from the crew, as well as being successful at Mush Hunting. Having a  Diplomat or  Polyvalent crew member also helps a lot - against the dangers of meeting alien species, and to increase the chance of recovering Starmap Fragments from Cristalite zones.\n\n\n\nGoals for Mush\nHumans are so weak that you can clearly have fun with them in many ways.  It's fun to see them kill each other thinking they have you trapped.  Whatever you do, you have two major goals.  \n\n\nDestroy the Daedalus\nBOOOM! A beautiful explosion. That's what we love.  Bodies floating in space among the debris of the vessel.\n The Mush have an instinct for destruction that is insatiable, and there are several possibilities to achieve a beautiful result including contamination, attrition, confusion and good ol' murder. \n\n\nInfiltration of Sol or Eden\nAnother way to ensure a Mush triumph is to infiltrate Sol or Eden when by having the Deadalus arrive there with live Mush on board. If you can stay alive and under the radar until the crew finishes PILGRED - or even do this yourself - you can sabotage the crew's ultimate directive by infecting either the Rebellion or the new colony, ensuring their downfall rather than the ultimate eradication of the Mush virus.\n\n\nSurprise, gentlemen!\n\nA Mush return to Sol is the always looming rush or surprise return, where the Mush themselves - usually  Raluca with some help, or  Paola with an opportune trade - finish PILGRED and jump the ship towards their waiting friends before the crew knows what is going on.\n\n\n\nThis is very powerful and should not be ignored by either team.\n\n\nThe fungus among us\n\nThe high art of  Mush infiltration, and definitely the required path to infiltrate Eden, is to make the crew believe they have won and are free of Mush. Besides good mimickry, this requires one or more beta Mush so at least two \"Alphas\" can be killed, the use of  Anonymush on the surviviors, and an infected or dead  Eleesha.\n\n\n\nOf course, the ship being in such a dire situation that the humans are forced to just gamble and hope they got every Mush can help as well.\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from \"http://www.mushpedia.com/index.php?title=Aim_of_the_Game&oldid=12893\"\t\t\t\t\n \n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\nCreate accountLog in \n\n\n\nNamespaces\n\nPage\nDiscussion\n\n\n\n\n\nVariants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViews\n\nRead\nView source\nView history\n\n\n\nActions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\n\nMain page\nRecent changes\nNews\nRandom page\nHelp\n\n\n\n\nTools\n\n\nWhat links here\nRelated changes\nSpecial pages\nPrintable version\nPermanent link\nPage information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last modified on 2 May 2017, at 10:31.\nThis page has been accessed 31,437 times.\n\n\nPrivacy policy\nAbout Mushpedia\nDisclaimers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
